## Authentication

Authentication for the RevenueCat REST API is achieved by setting the Authorization header with a valid API key. You'll find two types of API keys in your RevenueCat dashboard: public and secret.

Certain endpoints require secret keys, which should be kept out of any publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth. See our Authentication guide for more information.

```
print('Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY')
```
